# Plug and play integration

Put this line of code anywhere in your web app to get access to our domain resolution search box.

```html

```

If you would like to further customize the search box in your UI, here are some simple steps to help you launch the same demo app above locally on your machine. More complete documentation is coming soon!

mkdir test-out-namicorn && cd $_
git clone https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/namicorn-searchbar.git ./
